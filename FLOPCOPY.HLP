FLOPCOPY allows you to make a working copy of CLIPPER for use
on a machine with two 360K floppy drives.  You will need 3
formatted diskettes.  If you need to prepare diskettes, press 
Control-C to exit this batch file.

The syntax is:

        A> FLOPCOPY <d>: 

where <d>: is the drive you are copying to.  Detailed
instructions are in chapter 2 of the Clipper Manual.
