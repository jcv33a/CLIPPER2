    DBU is a multi-purpose utility designed to aid the developer
with data file manipulation without having to resort to writing
a myriad of short programs to accomplish simple tasks. The primary
functions available in this first release are:

    1. Help
    2. Set View
    3. Edit
    4. Create/Modify Structure
    5. Index

    Any function may be accessed at any time by pressing the
assigned function key (there is no menu structure). The help
system describes the various functions and sub-functions in
context (14 help screens in all).


                       COMMAND LINE
                       ------------

    A file name may be entered on the command line when the
program is invoked. The file may be either a view (.VEW) file
or a data (.DBF) file. If no extension is entered the current
or specified directory is searched for a .VEW file first and,
if not found, a .DBF file. If some other extension is entered,
the file is assumed to be a data file. In any case, the view
is set and EDIT mode is selected automatically. If no command
line parameter is entered, SET VIEW is the default mode.


                         SET VIEW
                         --------

    The view system is an on-screen matrix which illustrates the
current status with regard to data files, index files, fields,
relations, and filter. The first screen to appear will be divided
into rows and columns. From top to bottom, the rows describe data
files, index files, and field lists. Each column represents a
database work area. When at least one file has been opened, it
becomes possible to cursor around the screen and set up a data
"view".

To set relations and/or filter, press ^PgDn. The bottom portion
of the screen will be overwritten with a visual representation
of current relations and one optional filter expression. Multi-
child relations are fully supported.

    Once established, the current view may be saved in a disk
file and restored at a later time. The system provides a default
extension of ".VEW" for these files.


                           EDIT
                           ----

    The contents of data files may be altered and new records
appended. Data is formatted according to the current data "view"
with records listed vertically. Each record is displayed as a
series of fields on a single row and the contents of any field
may be edited where it appears on the screen. Horizontal and
vertical scrolling are supported along with a menu of search
functions to seek, goto, or locate specific records.


                  CREATE/MODIFY STRUCTURE
                  -----------------------

    A new file template is provided upon entry. Pressing the
"Read" key allows an existing file structure to be read and
modified. Data is preserved for fields with the same name as
in the original file.


                           INDEX
                           -----

    Index files may be quickly generated or modified. The key
to an existing index may be read and edited for convenience.
