CLIPCOPY installs CLIPPER in the current directory of your hard
disk.

The syntax is:

        A> CLIPCOPY <d>: 

where <d>: is the drive you are copying to.  Detailed
instructions are in chapter 2 of the Clipper Manual.

After installation, add \CLIPPER to your path.  This will allow
you to compile and link your programs in other directories using
the CL and CLD batch files.
